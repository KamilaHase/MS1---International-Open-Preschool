# International Open Preschool - International Öppna Förskola

In Sweden, there is a state funded institution called "öppna förskola" which is provided for parents on parental leave as an indoor space to go 
and spend time with their small children. There are few educators but they don´t take any responsibility for the children, it is always their parents duty.
This place could be also called a "playgroup" or "indoor playground". 

Unfortunately despite the amout of expats and foreigners living in Gothenburg, Sweden, there is no such place that would be dedicated to English speaking parents, 
although there is a high demand for such place and many small playgroups are organized by individual parents through social media.
Therefore I created this fictional project called "International Open Preschool". 
The main goal is to present a nice indoor playground for English speaking parents where they can meet other parents and socialize while their children can play around.

This website and place are fictional although I personally believe that if it would existed, there would be a high demand for its services in Gothenburg.
 
## UX
### User stories:
  - Expected first time visitors of page:
    1. English speaking parents who just recently moved to Gothenburg and are trying to get to know some people-other parents.
    2. English speaking parents who are looking for a place where they can speak English with other parents and/or provide a place for their kids to find other English speaking children.
    2. Parents who are looking for a convenient place where to go with their kids during winter.
    3. Parents who want to find out more information about what to do in Gothenburg with children, they are interested in Events.
    4. Parents who are looking for some specific help and want to reach out to us.
    5. Other children professionals who want to give advice to parents, therefore they visit the web as a part of their research for giving advice.

  - Expected second time visitors of page:
    1. Trying to find the address
    2. Going to book their attendance at an event
    3. Need to verify information
    4. Going to send in a query

**First Time Visitor Goals** - I am a mother who just moved to Gothenburg and I am looking for a place to go with my toddler during the winter.
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Contact page - the validation could be more playfull such as "Looks good" / "Please provide a valid email", did´t have time for that
- Contact page - viewer sees whole screen when opening page, failed to put pictures to the left side of the text

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

####Website has been tested and corrected by: 
- https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html
- https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
    - Events - <section class="events-intro"> lacks heading - this is on purpose
    - Getting around - <section class="getting-around-intro" - this is on purpose
                     - <section class="geting-around"> - this is on purpose
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
    - problems shown in the Circles area - shape-margin and shape-outside does not exist. This part of code has been copied (see link below) therefore I will keep it as it is.

####Bug problems

- Scroll to left - I am having a lot of problems getting rid of the horizontal scroll space. I have contacted tutors but all advice so far failed
- Problems with circles and general responsiveness
- problems with loading class
- problems with JS
- problems with footer not wanting to be at the bottom

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
